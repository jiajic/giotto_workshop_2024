# Creating a Giotto object

Jiaji George Chen

August 5th 2024

### Used packages
```
Giotto      GiottoClass     GiottoData      pak
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
save_dir <- "~/Documents/GitHub/giotto_workshop_2024/img/01_session4"
```

## Overview

*Giotto* has representations for both aggregated (cell by count) + xy(z) 
information and subcellular polygon or mask information and transcript xy(z)
or image information. A *Giotto* object can be set up from either of the two
above sets of information.

## From matrix + locations

```
createGiottoObject()
```

## From subcellular raw data (transcripts or images) + polygons

```
createGiottoObjectSubcellular()
```

The above two methods accept data, converts them into Giotto's compatible
formats, and then assembles the final giotto object.

If desired you can also assemble a giotto object piece-wise after creating
the Giotto subobjects manually.

## From piece-wise

```
g <- giotto()
g <- setGiotto(g, ??)
```

## Using convenience functions for popular technologies (Vizgen, Xenium, CosMx, â€¦)

There are also several convenience functions we provide for loading in data
from popular platforms. Many of these will be touched on later during other
sessions
```
createGiottoVisiumObject()
createGiottoVisiumHDObject()
createGiottoXeniumObject()
createGiottoCosMxObject()
createGiottoMerscopeObject()
```

## Spatial plots

Giotto has several spatial plotting functions.
At the lowest level, you directly call `plot()` on several subobjects in order
to see what they look like, particularly the ones containing spatial info.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gpoints <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("giottoPoints")
gpoly <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("giottoPolygon")
spatlocs <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("spatLocsObj")
spatnet <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("spatialNetworkObj")
pca <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("dimObj")
plot(pca, dims = c(3,10))
```

## Subsetting

-   Based on IDs
-   Based on locations
-   Visualizations



## Mini objects & GiottoData

Giotto makes available several mini objects to allow devs and users to work
with easily loadable Giotto objects. These are small subsets of a larger
dataset that often contain some worked through analyses and are fully functional.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pak("drieslab/GiottoData")
```
