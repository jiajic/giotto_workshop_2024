## Introduction to spatial dataset

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02_session3/Xenium-General-Workflow-1024x709.png")
```

This is the 10X Xenium FFPE Human Lung Cancer dataset. Xenium captures
individual transcript detections with a spatial resolution of 100s of
nanometers, providing an extremely highly resolved subcellular spatial
dataset. This particular dataset also showcases their newly released
multimodal cell segmentation outputs.

The Xenium Human Multi-Tissue and Cancer Panel (377) genes was used. The
exported data is from their Xenium Onboard Analysis v2.0.0 pipeline.

The full data for this example can be found here:
[here](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/preview-data-ffpe-human-lung-cancer-with-xenium-multimodal-cell-segmentation-1-standard)

-   *Input Files* are additional files that are not part of the output
    bundles, usually some raw files the pipeline uses or extra info.
-   *Output Files* are the directories that are exported by the Xenium
    pipeline that can be expected from every run.

## Additional package requirements
When working with this data, some additional packages must be downloaded.
-   arrow is needed
-   requires ZTSD codec to open these parquets.


## Introduce mini object


```{r, eval=FALSE}
save_dir <- "~/Documents/GitHub/giotto_workshop_2024/img/02_session3"
```
